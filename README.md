# Metro UI Native

A Faithful recreation of the Metro UI in React Native. This project serves as a boierplate for the Metro Suite of projects, which aims to bring the Metro UI to the Android Platform. This project is still in its early stages, expect drastic changes as it happens.

## Building

To build this project, you will need to have the following installed:
1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
3. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or An Android Device with expo installed.
4. [Expo](https://expo.io/)
5. [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

Once you have all of these installed, you can clone this repository and run `yarn install` to install all of the dependencies. 
Then, you can run `yarn start` to start the development server.

Alternatively, if you are a deranged person like me, you can use npm instead of yarn. To do this, run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies, and then run `npm start` to start the development server.

To launch the app on your device, you can use the Expo Go app, or you can use Android Studio to build the app and install it on your device.
You can reset the build by running `expo start --clear` or `npm start --clear` or `yarn start --clear`.
